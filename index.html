            <li><b>STRUCTURED CHAOS</b>: Creativity often comes from chaos. Embrace it, but don't let it control you.</li>
            <li><b>CONFLICT AND CREATIVITY</b>: It's okay to disagree. Conflict can lead to better ideas and innovations.</li>
            <li><b>COMMUNICATION</b>: Resolving conflicts and problems requires respectful communication. It's important to address conflicts and problems as soon as possible and not let them escalate.</li>
            <li><b>INNOVATION</b>: Always look for better ways to do things. Innovation is the key to progress.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>Human nature is complex. People are different, and not everyone will understand your principles or rules just because they are told to. Good and evil exist, and everyone comes from different cultures with different perspectives. Some people don't speak English or know how to communicate, and some people don't have the mental capacity or knowledge to understand complicated things. It's important to remember that things will never be perfect if humans are involved, so it's important to keep a balance between everything. <span aria-hidden="true"><><</span></p>
