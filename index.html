    <h2>MEANING OF FISH <><</h2>
    <p>FISH <>< COMMUNITY is made out of multiple communities, each with its own leadership and rules. All communities work together and follow the same principles.</p>

    <h3>MEANING OF FISH <><</h3>
    <p><b><</b> represents an increase in chaos.</p>
    <p><b>></b> represents the process of adding structure to reduce the chaos.</p>
    <p><b><</b> despite adding structure, chaos increases again.</p>
    <p><b><><</b> symbolizes a process where chaos increases, structure is added to create some order, but then chaos increases again, resulting in a state of <b>"STRUCTURED CHAOS"</b></p>
    <p>This is the main <>< group, you can find all the fish verified groups at "FISH VERIFIED <><" FISHVE.7823 verification group</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>COMMUNITY PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>FUN</b>: Don't forget to have fun</li>
        <li><b>COMMON SENSE</b>: Not everything needs a rule, sometimes the best guide is common sense.</li>
        <li><b>STRUCTURED CHAOS</b>: Creativity often comes from chaos. Embrace it, but don't let it control you.</li>
        <li><b>CONFLICT AND CREATIVITY</b>: It's okay to disagree. Conflict can lead to better ideas and innovations.</li>
        <li><b>COMMUNICATION</b>: Resolving conflicts and problems requires respectful communication. It's important to address conflicts and problems as soon as possible and not let them escalate.</li>
        <li><b>INNOVATION</b>: Always look for better ways to do things. Innovation is the key to progress.</li>
        <li><b>HUMILITY</b>: Don't let your ego get in the way. Everyone has something to teach you.</li>
        <li><b>SIMPLICITY</b>: The simplest solution is often the best one. Don't overcomplicate things.</li>
        <li><b>DECENCY</b>: Don't be a degenerate. Treat others with respect and kindness.</li>
        <li><b>OPEN-MINDEDNESS</b>: Be open to new ideas and experiences. They're the best way to learn and grow.</li>
        <li><b>AUTHENTICITY</b>: Don't keep pretending to be someone you're not, it's a waste of energy</li>
        <li><b>SUCCESS AND CREATIVITY</b>: Success and money are important, but they shouldn't limit your creativity. Use them as tools for growth, not as the final goal.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Human nature is complex. People are different, and not everyone will understand your principles or rules just because they are told to. Good and evil exist, and everyone comes from different cultures with different perspectives. Some people don't speak English or know how to communicate, and some people don't have the mental capacity or knowledge to understand complicated things. It's important to remember that things will never be perfect if humans are involved, so it's important to keep a balance between everything. <><</p>
