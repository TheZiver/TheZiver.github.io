                <li>Permission to post in ＃fish-news</li>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>
            <p><b>Why is TheZiver not verifying my community?</b><br>- Check out FISH_CERTIFIED which has an objective criteria‚ more info at theziver․com</p>
            <p><b>Can a community get unverified?</b><br>- Yes‚ TheZiver is able to unverify communities for any reason․</p>
            <p><b>How to apply for verification?</b><br>- Send a DM to TheZiver on discord</p>
            <p><b>Why is FISH VERIFIED so TheZiver dependent?</b><br>- FISH VERIFIED is curated by TheZiver to set standards for other communities to follow. However, the structured chaos community ecosystem is designed to grow on its own, even without TheZiver in charge. If a community goes against the established community principles, norms, or structure chaos philosophy, the ecosystem will backfire because of self-organization.</p>

                <h3>FAQ</h3>
                <p><b>What does ＂active＂ entail?</b><br>- If 2 months pass without any group events （like meetups‚ content releases‚ or projects）‚ the group will be marked ＂inactive＂․ Basic group posts don't prevent this․</p>
                <p><b>If a group is certified and then goes inactive‚ will it be uncertified?</b><br>- No‚ it will remain certified․ The ＂inactive＂ status is mainly for internal tracking․</p>
                <p><b>Can a community get uncertified?</b><br>- Yes‚ but only if it changes in a way that breaks the original criteria （e․g․‚ drops below 100 members‚ changes its core theme away from FISH ＜＞＜‚ stops being SFW‚ or goes against ＜＞＜ principles․</p>
                <p><b>How to apply for certification?</b><br>- Once you're confident your group meets all the criteria‚ send a DM to TheZiver․</p>
